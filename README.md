# ImageMatchGame

Android application mainly designed for children entering the world of preschool and beginning their paths as students but it also works with users at any age when they are learning a new language. The goal is to design a fun touchscreen application that teaches users the names of animals and birds through a memory matching game.
### Main Features of the App:
- A simple matching game that allows the player to click on a card to see the picture behind.
- When the picture of an animal is displayed, the name of that animal is also played (as a soundfile).
- The player can only see two cards at a time.
- If two pictures are matched, they will be removed from the game board.
- Score is calculated based on the game completion time â€“ your choice!- Players will see the score at the end of the game and they can then exit or restart the game.
- The animals/birds/ locations is set randomly at the beginning of the game.
- The app should handle the orientation changes correctly.
For database implementation:
- A login screen where users enter their usernames
- A history log window
- A database to store the usernames, scores, and timestamp
